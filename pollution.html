		<p><b>Plastic Pollution : </b>is caused by the accumulation of plastic waste in the environment.Plastic pollution is occured in the ocean, especially on land.How does plastic cause pollution?
When plastic is produced, it's made from toxic materials such as benzene and vinyl hydrochloride. It is destined to be toxic from birth to forever. These chemicals are known to cause cancer, and the manufacturing byproducts contaminate our air and soil. The type of plastic that is the major source of dioxin is PVC. </p>

		<p><b> Plastic On Land</b> :Effects of plastic on land
Plastic pollution on land poses a threat to the plants and animals â€“ including humans who are based on the land.[53] Estimates of the amount of plastic concentration on land are between four and twenty three times that of the ocean. The amount of plastic poised on the land is greater and more concentrated than that in the water.[54] Mismanaged plastic waste ranges from 60 percent in East Asia and Pacific to one percent in North America. The percentage of mismanaged plastic waste reaching the ocean annually and thus becoming plastic marine debris is between one third and one half the total mismanaged waste for that year.[55][56]

Chlorinated plastic can release harmful chemicals into the surrounding soil, which can then seep into groundwater or other surrounding water sources and also the ecosystem of the world.</p>

		<p><b> Plastic In Water</b> :A 2017 study found that 83% of tap water samples taken around the world contained plastic pollutants.[60][61] This was the first study to focus on global drinking water pollution with plastics,[62] and showed that with a contamination rate of 94%, tap water in the United States was the most polluted, followed by Lebanon and India. European countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France had the lowest contamination rate, though still as high as 72%.[60] This means that people may be ingesting between 3,000 and 4,000 microparticles of plastic from tap water per year.[62] The analysis found particles of more than 2.5 microns in size, which is 2500 times bigger than a nanometer. It is currently unclear if this contamination is affecting human health, but if the water is also found to contain nano-particle pollutants, there could be adverse impacts on human well-being, according to scientists associated with the studyThe ocean is home to all kinds of creatures.
